# Tetris
A traditional old game which demonstrate html/css/javascript 

Here are several ways to run this game locally:
Using Python's Simple HTTP Server (Simplest way):
Then open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000

Using Node.js http-server (If you have Node.js installed):
Then open your browser and visit the displayed address (usually http://localhost:8080)

Using VSCode Live Server extension:
Install "Live Server" extension in VSCode
Right-click on index.html file
Select "Open with Live Server"
It will automatically open the game in your browser

Note: Since the game uses ES6 modules, opening the HTML file directly from the file system (using file:// protocol) won't work due to CORS policy, so you need to serve it through an HTTP server.
